For Typescript


npm install -g typescript


to convert ts file to js we type ======== tsc <filename.ts> ========= this creates a js file and this file is referenvced in index.html

tsc --init ===> this command creates a tsconfig.json file where we can specify the configurations for the ts file

once tsconfig.json file is created, we can just complie all the ts files using just tsc command not tsc <filename.ts> as config file gets into act
